        <h2>Benefits of Organic Farming</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><p> <strong>Environment-friendly: </strong>The farming of organic products is free of chemicals and fertilisers, so it does not harm the environment.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Nutritional:</strong> As compared to chemical and fertiliser-utilised products, organic products are more nutritional, tasty, and good for health.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>High demand: </strong>There is a huge demand for organic products in India and across the globe, which generates more income through export.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Good return on Investment: </strong>With the usage of cheaper and local inputs, a farmer can make a good return on investment.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Economical: </strong>In organic farming, no expensive fertilisers, pesticides, or HYV seeds are required for the plantation of crops. Therefore, there is no extra expense.</p></li>            
        </ul>
        <h2>How to Transition to Organic Farming</h2>
        <p>If you’re already running a farm, or have a small garden on your property, and you want to make the switch to organic farming, be warned that there are many obstacles you’ll face. The shift for us took time, but we will tell you right now it was worth every challenge. The biggest challenges you’ll find are:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Developing a plan</li>
            <li>Identifying and switching to natural inputs</li>
            <li>Ensuring quality and quantity of outputs</li>
        </ol>
        <p>When making the switch, it helps to do plenty of research on the types of inputs (and quantities) you’ll need to go organic. You’ll also want to look into the transition period - how long does it take to change to new inputs, when is the best time to do so, and what, if any, consequences will it have on the land. </p>

            <h2 style="color: black;">Step-by-Step Guide to Organic Farming</h2>
            <p>So, if you’re ready to get started with organic farming, this handy step-by-step guide will help you get started. A quick disclaimer: this is by no means an exhaustive list, and you’ll likely need to supplement this with further research around your exact situation. For example, what works for us, a dairy farm, may not be right for producing vegetables, and a home garden will likely require a much simpler solution than a commercial farm.</p>
            <h3>Step 1 - Considerations for changing to organic farming</h3>
            <p>The first step is to review your situation and understand what exact considerations, unique to your situation, need to be accounted for. These include:</p>
            <h4>Location of the land</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Farm characteristics: size, plots and crops distribution, which kind of crops, trees,animals are integrated in the farm system.</li>
                <li>Soil Analysis: an evaluation of the soil structure, nutrient levels, organic matter content, erosion level, and/or the soil have been contaminated</li>
                <li>Climate: rainfall distribution and quantity, temperatures, frost risks, humidity.</li>
                <li>Organic matter sources and management (manures)</li>
                <li>Presence of animal housing systems and/or machinery.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Step 2 - Gather Information</h3>
            <p>Take the time to learn organic farming practices relevant to you. For example, what does organic farming look like if you grow root vegetables? What do you need to do if you run an orchard? What about if you’re raising cattle or operating a dairy farm?</p>
            <h3>Step 3 - Crop selection</h3>
            <p>You might also need to plant crops for any animals you have, so that you can move towards a self-sustaining system instead of relying on external inputs for feed. During this step, you’ll also need to consider the equipment needed to manage the crops you choose or consider how to maintain the crops and whether it is a viable option for you based on the resources you have available.</p>
            <h3>Step 4 - Mulching</h3>
            <p>Mulching plays a crucial role in preventing soil erosion. By covering the topsoil in natural plant materials, surface runoff can be prevented when it rains. As the material decomposes it boosts the amount of organic matter in the soil, helping create a stable structure. When choosing your mulch, you’ve got plenty of options: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Weeds or cover crops </li>
                <li>Crop residues </li>
                <li>Grass, pruning material from trees and hedges</li>
                <li>Wastes from agricultural processing or from forestry</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Step 5 - Water management</h3>
            <p>For a lot of us, water management is a big reason why we go organic. Scarcity of water is an issue around the world, so the more efficiently we use it the better. Water management focuses on three principles: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Water retention</li>
                <li>Water harvesting</li>
                <li>Water storage</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Step 6 - Crop planning</h3>
        <p>With traditional farming, it’s a bit easier to plant a variety of crops, especially when you have plenty of space. In an organic system, planning your crops is much more important to success. Crop rotation (planting different crops in the field from season to season) and intercropping (planting different crops in close proximity to each other) are two methods that will help improve soil health and fertility. It’s also vital that you keep good, accurate and detailed records of your crops. You want to ensure that, over time, you are maintaining soil health and recording crop yields to continually improve your results.</p>
        <h3>Step 7 - Nutrient management</h3>
        <p>Ensuring soil fertility is a key goal of nutrient management. As crops grow and animals graze, nutrients are removed from the land and must be replaced. In traditional farming, nitrogen-based fertilisers are great for this but, in an organic system, you’ll need to look at other methods. Green manure (plants grown for the purpose of building nutrients in the soil), animal manure and organic fertilisers can be used, depending on your needs and situation. Composting also plays a large role here, helping turn organic material into natural fertiliser</p>
        <h3>Step 8 - Pest management</h3>
        <p>When it comes to pests and disease, there are two phases: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Management - keeping existing populations and diseases low</li>
            <li>Control - killing pests and removing diseases</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Step 9 - Weed management</h3>
        <p>For organic farmers, the priority should be preventing foreign species and weeds rather than removing them once they are detected. This means that the goal is to not eliminate all weeds, as this is an intensive exercise, but to maintain them at a level that is viable for the health of the farm and is economically sound. For example, weeds help provide a home for pest-controlling species, as well as offering cover that reduces soil erosion. </p>
        <h3>Step 10 - Soil management</h3>
        <p>When it comes to soil management for organic farms, the focus is on:</p>
        <h4>Creating good growing conditions for plants by</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Improving aeration</li>
            <li>Loosening the soil</li> 
            <li>Encouraging activity of soil organisms</li>
            <li>Increasing water filtration</li>
            <li>Managing pests and weeds, among other things.</li>                        
        </ul>
        <h3>Step 11 - Animal husbandry</h3>
        <p>Introducing animals into crop-producing farms is a key component of organic farming. It increases the number of natural resources available through manure, can control pest populations (think of chickens constantly roaming) and aid in weed management (cattle and goats grazing). For some, having animals simply isn’t possible, and again this comes down to understanding your situation and needs, but if you can incorporate animals on your farm then you definitely should.</p>
